## 📖 Overview
With the explosion of online reviews, understanding public opinion about movies is crucial for studios, critics, and audiences.  
This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to automatically analyze the sentiment of movie reviews.

The workflow:
- 🧹 Text Preprocessing (cleaning, tokenizing, removing stopwords)
- 🔠 TF-IDF Vectorization
- 🤖 Model Training with Logistic Regression
- 📊 Evaluation on test data
- 🌐 Deployment via **Streamlit** for real-time predictions
